# Minesweeper-Game
This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game, built using C++ and key Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (DSA) concepts. The goal of the project is to simulate the game logic, board generation, and reveal mechanism using efficient structures such as 2D arrays, recursion, queues, and adjacency traversal.
